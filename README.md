## Inversion
> An application to count the number of inversions in a list of integers.

_What is an inversion?_ An inversion is when two elements in the array are not in
sorted order, or more formally, `a[i]` and `a[j]` form an inversion if
`a[i] > a[j]` and `i < j`.

## Usage
From the cloned repo's folder, run:

```go build```

```./inversion <file_name.txt>```

The file should include a list of integers separated by newlines.
